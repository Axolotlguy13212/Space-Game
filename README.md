# Space Game
Prototype made for [GASP Game Development Camp](https://www.jsu.edu/gasp/)

We had a week to make a game, and we had to use Godot. This is my first Godot game. (My Teacher let me use C#, despite the fact that he was teaching GDscript)

Due to the time crunch, no aliens were actually added to the game. I will expand upon this, but this is what my team made within a week.

Narrative = Tanner

Pixel Artist - Axl

Concept Artist - Riley H.

Audio - Riley Turner (Me)

Programmer - Riley Turner (Me) (btw, all of the GDscript files in the repo is just me converting C# to GDscript with ChatGPT so he can help, I never bothered to delete them)

# How to Compile

NOTE: IF YOU JUST WANT TO PLAY THE GAME, USE THE LINK ABOVE

The Game is made in Godot 4.4.1, and is made using C#. To compile, install:

[Godot 4.4.1 (.NET Version)](https://godotengine.org/download/)

[.NET SDK 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

Install those, then you can either clone the repo and open the project.godot file when importing a project, or download the repo as a zip and import that into Godot.

NOTE: BE SURE TO INSTALL THE .NET VERSION OF GODOT (Grey Button), NOT THE NORMAL ONE (Blue Button) and install .net sdk 8.0, not 9 or anything.
